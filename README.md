# Understanding doctors' perspectives on, and experiences with, AI

This project aimed to understand doctors' experiences with, and perceptions of, artificial intelligence (AI) through a wide scale survey of UK doctors registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). The aim of the research undertaken was to understand how AI systems are used and perceived by doctors. It also sought to explore doctors' views on opportunities, challenges, and their professional responsibilities when using AI. The motivation for this work was to obtain insights from a range of practice areas to understand the difference and impact of AI systems on clinical practice, doctors' decision-making processes, and outcomes, as perceived by a sample of GMC registered doctors. This research has culminated in a report entitled "**One in four doctors are using artificial intelligence: Exploring doctors' perspectives on medical AI in the age of large language models**", which is available here: **to insert link when available**.
