Execution order

weighting.r <- take raw dataset, do some data cleaning, and produce clean dataset with weight variable attached

statistics.r <- take weighted dataset and perform per question aggregation into sub datasets 

graphics.r <- take output from above and make graphics 


To do:
1. Just the table of questions divided by demographics is left to be checked but I should definitely change that table at the end. 
2. check AI use details with MIMDE. 

Notice Saba:
All other tables and figures are finalised. you don't need to check them again!
