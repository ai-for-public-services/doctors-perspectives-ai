5. Methodology for interview sample selection - explanation

ways to consider weighting and deal with missing variables
1. NAs imputation in the dataset:
  - conditional mean or mode of the group  
  - Random sampling from the group of related variables 
  - imputation with multinomial regression 
  - whether to impute more than missing values or 
2. weight imputation
 - By regression based on variables which is not missing. 
3. imputation for records which is not available in the dataset. 
 - Should I impute dependent variables? wait for response from Javier
 
parallel assumption test for logistic regressions. 
1. I should do frequency of sample before imputation in the table. 
2. Update the questions and also the sum to be 100.

1. does weighting should be done after imputing NAs
2. what is KNN and is it a good method od imputing? 

Model tests for logistic regression:
Null deviance: -2*Ln(L(P)) - p: The probability of being 1 based on the y - a priori
Residual deviance:  -2 * Log Likelihood(model)
AIC = 2*k + Residual Deviance - penalizes for number of parameters in the model. 

hoslem test looks good -A high p-value (> 0.05) indicates that the model fits the data well, while a low p-value (â‰¤ 0.05) suggests a poor fit - This test looks good - It groups data into categories usually 10
R2_McFadden <- 1 - (logLik_model / logLik_null)
R2_CoxSnell <- 1 - exp((2 / n) * (logLik_null - logLik_model))
R2_Nagelkerke: R2_CoxSnell / (1 - exp((2 / n) * logLik_null))
Nagelkerke's R-squared: Adjusts Cox and Snell's R-squared to cover the full range from 0 to 1


Deviance and Likelihood Ratio Test - 
A low p-value (typically < 0.05) indicates that the predictors significantly improve the model fit 
which means the null hypothesis is rejected, suggesting significant difference between model and null model
anova(null_model, model, test = "Chisq")

The Brant test is designed to assess the proportional odds assumption in ordinal logistic regression models. 
The steps:
1. An ordinal logistic regression model is fit using the entire dataset. This involves estimating the coefficients assuming that the proportional odds assumption holds.

2. For each level j of the ordinal outcome variable, separate binary logistic regression models are fit. Each of these models compares the probability of the outcome being at or below level j versus above level j.

3. The coefficients from the binary logistic regression models are compared to the coefficients from the full ordinal logistic regression model.

4. The Brant test statistic is calculated by comparing the log-likelihoods of the separate binary logistic models to the log-likelihood of the full ordinal logistic regression model. Specifically, the test examines whether the coefficients for each predictor are equal across the different binary logistic models.
